# Mapping_Earthquakes
 
## Overview of the Project:

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.



### Purpose:

Difference in Earthquake magnitude around the world.

## Resources

**Data Source:** GeoJSON, Earthquakes greater 4.5 mag GeoJSON

## Results:

Earthquakes are represented by a circle and color, higher magnitude shown with larger diameter, and darker colorr. Also a  popup marker that, when clicked, shows the magnitude and location of the earthquake.




## Summary

The Analysis shows earthquake data link to the tectonic platesâ€™ location, and earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and the data on a 3rd map.
